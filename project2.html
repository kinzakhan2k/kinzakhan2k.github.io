							<h2>Revitalization of the Lansdowne Underpass</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
						The site is located in the Parkdale neighborhood of Toronto, specifically at the Lansdowne Underpass. This area can be accessed via two main entrances: one from Dundas Street West, a short 5-minute walk, and another from Queen Street, which is a longer distance. Additionally, there is a stairway connecting the underpass to a nearby residential neighborhood.
						My project aims to improve accessibility to the Lansdowne Underpass from both Dundas Street West and Queen Street, particularly through public transit. The project also focuses on enhancing safety measures in the area and improving the visibility and appreciation of the existing artwork within the underpass, which is currently only visible at night due to inadequate lighting.

						<h2>Collaboration with StART Underpass Program (StART UP)</h2>
						<p>
							By partnering with the StART Underpass Program (StART UP), my aim is to kickstart a transformative initiative for underpasses in the community. StART UP specializes in revitalizing underpasses by enhancing lighting, improving sidewalks and walking conditions, implementing pigeon proofing measures, and removing weeds. Often, the installation of murals or street art acts as the catalyst for these improvements. (City of Toronto)
							My goal is to leverage the expertise of StART UP to learn from their skills and experiences. I plan to collaborate closely with them to offer my design concepts and work together to achieve our shared objective of enhancing the Lansdowne Underpass.

						<h2>Interactive Graffiti Lights</h2>
						<p>
						As part of the larger project aimed at revitalizing the underpass, I focused on enhancing the graffiti artwork contributed by local artists. To honor their creativity and amplify their impact, I installed LED lighting with motion sensors. These lights, designed in the colors of the graffiti, not only illuminate the underpass but also respect the essence of the art itself. When activated, the underpass becomes a canvas alive with vibrant hues, turning the artwork itself into a source of illumination.
						This innovative design not only adds to the aesthetic appeal of the underpass but also contributes to its safety. As passersby, residents, and pedestrians walk by, the illuminated artwork provides a sense of security, transforming the underpass into a welcoming and safe space for all. 
						Additionally, the staircase leading to the underpass now includes a ramp, making the area more accessible to all members of the community.

					<h2>Green Community Bus Stop</h2>
					<p>
						To further enhance safety and transit, I designed a bus stop near the underpass. This bus stop serves as a hub for social activity, encouraging community interaction and making the area more vibrant and secure. The bus stop features an innovative rain collection system that captures rainwater from above and transforms it into heat for the shelter, ensuring warmth for users during the winter despite its open design.

				<h2>Emergency Kiosk Device
				</h2>
				<p>
				The bus stop includes an emergency kiosk machine, providing a direct line to the Toronto Police and helpline services, enhancing safety and security for all users upon just one tap.
				By improving transit access, fostering a lively social environment, and incorporating safety and comfort features, the project seeks to transform the Lansdowne Underpass into a more accessible, safer, and engaging space for the community.
